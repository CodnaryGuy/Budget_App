# Budget_App
The Project is related to "Budget Manager" which is developed by using vanilla JavaScript.
I also used some HTML and CSS in the project.

# Functionalities :
* This app shows the balance, the income and the outcome. 
* It also has a dashboard where the user can add a new entry (an income or an expense), he can toggle between the income list (that show only all income entries) 
  and the expenses list (that shows only the outcome entries) and all list that shows all the entries.
* The user can also edit or delete an entry.
* This app has a Pie chart, so the user can easily compare the income and outcome.
* The user's income and expense entry list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page or reboot his machine, he can always find his data there.

# Tools Used:
* Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
